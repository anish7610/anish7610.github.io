## Key Projects

___A lot of projects are a result of casual coding. Literally, lost track of it.___

**Definition:** Casual coding refers to using coding for non-professional, often personal, projects or for learning purposes. It encompasses a wide range of activities, from simple scripting to more complex projects, and is often characterized by a relaxed approach to learning and development. This contrasts with the formal and often rigorous practices of professional software development.

| **Project**                                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
